# Agent Labs

A carefully curated collection of labs, notes, and graded assignments from multiple DeepLearning.ai courses focused on prompt engineering, LLM systems, agentic workflows, LangChain/LangGraph, multi-agent frameworks, RAG, and advanced system designs.  
This repository serves as a practical foundation for for understanding all the basics before starting building real agentic applications, from simple prompt pipelines to multi-agent orchestration and production-ready AI systems.

- **01_prompt_engineering:** Prompting techniques, best-practice patterns, and structured output strategies.  
- **02_building_systems_with_ChatGPT_API:** System design with OpenAI APIs, tool use, function calling, and evaluation.  
- **03_langchain:** Chains, tool integrations, workflow modularity, and system patterns.  
- **04_langGraph:** Graph-based agentic workflow design with nodes, edges, and stateful reasoning.  
- **05_crewAI:** Multi-agent collaboration using CrewAI (roles, tasks, tools, and handoffs).  
- **06_autoGen:** Multi-agent collaboration using AutoGen. 
- **07_rag_course:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation concepts— such as embeddings, retrieval functions, chunking, vector databases, and evaluation.

## Purpose

This repo is my playground and knowledge base for building modern agentic AI applications. Every module contributes toward developing scalable agents for real-world use cases.

## Recommended References

For deeper learning, the official documentation and free resources from LangChain/LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, OpenAI are excellent starting points. It goes without saying, DeepLearning.ai courses, especially those taught by Andrew Ng, provide strong foundations for LLM systems, and agentic workflows.

## Vision

This repository will continue to grow into a modular library of agentic patterns, a practical starting point for building production-ready LLM systems, autonomous workflows, and multi-agent solutions.
