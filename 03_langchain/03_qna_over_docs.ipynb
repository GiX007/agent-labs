So for queries on the index we use `llm_replacement_model` instead of the basic `llm_model` with temperature=0 (deterministic). This separation gives us flexibility aas we can use a high-capability/slower/more expensive model for creative output, and a cheaper/faster model for retrieval, indexing, or simpler tasks."

        "In this notebook, we retrieve and summarize shirts with sun protection in three different ways, but all yield the same results. First, we directly pass the combined document text (`qdocs`) to the LLM to generate a markdown table. Second, we use a `RetrievalQA` chain, where the retriever fetches relevant documents and the LLM summarizes them, essentially automating the retrieval and answer generation. Third, we use a `VectorstoreIndexCreator` to create an index from the documents and query it with the same LLM. Despite the different methods - manual concatenation, retrieval-augmented QA, or indexing — the underlying information and the output table remain consistent, demonstrating that LangChain offers multiple flexible ways to combine embeddings, retrieval, and LLMs to achieve the same semantic search and summarization results."
