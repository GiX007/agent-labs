        "In this notebook, we explored several key steps for working with Q&A datasets and LLM evaluation. First, we saw how to generate artificial Q&A pairs from a dataset using `QAGenerateChain` and combine them with existing examples. Next, we looked at manually evaluating responses with `langchain.debug = True` to inspect how the LLM answers each query. Finally, we used `QAEvalChain` to automatically evaluate responses: we ran `predictions = qa.apply(examples_flat)` where the inputs were the questions (`query`) and the outputs were the LLM's answers (`result`), and then `eval_chain.evaluate(examples_flat, predictions)` compared these predictions against the ground-truth answers to provide structured evaluation results. This workflow demonstrates a full loop from generating examples to automated assessment of LLM performance."
