    "# Graded Lab : Tool Use and Reflective Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore how AI agents can enhance research workflows by leveraging external tools and engaging in critical self-reflection. You'll learn how to build and integrate callable tools—such as web and academic search functions, and connect them to a language model using OpenAI's tool-calling API. Then, you’ll guide the agent to not only generate content but also **reflect** on its own output, improving the quality and depth of the final report. By the end of this lab, you will have implemented a mini agent capable of searching, reasoning, and publishing structured reports in HTML—laying the foundation for more advanced multi-step and autonomous AI systems."

      "### Overview of Recurrent Novae\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Definition\n",
      "Recurrent novae are a rare class of cataclysmic variable stars. They consist of a white dwarf and a companion star from which they accrete material until a thermonuclear reaction leads to a nova outburst. Unlike classical novae, recurrent novae experience multiple outbursts over timescales of decades to centuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Radio Observations\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Importance\n",
      "Radio observations of recurrent novae provide valuable insights into the shock interactions and ejected material following an outburst. They probe different physical processes compared to optical or X-ray observations.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Findings\n",
      "1. **Ejecta Interaction**: Post-outburst, the white dwarf ejects material that can collide with previous ejecta or the surrounding medium, producing synchrotron radiation visible in radio wavelengths.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Non-Thermal Emission**: Observations often exhibit non-thermal emission, indicative of shock-accelerated particles. This contrasts with the thermal emissions seen in optically-dominated studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Expanding Shells**: Radio arrays map expanding ejecta shells, helping to measure the expansion rate and mass-velocity profile of the outflow.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Magnetic Fields**: By analyzing polarization, radio studies can also infer properties of the magnetic field, which plays a crucial role in shaping nova eruptions and their remnants.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Case Studies\n",
      "- Well-studied recurrent novae such as T Pyxidis, U Scorpii, and RS Ophiuchi have been observed at radio frequencies. RS Ophiuchi, in particular, is a prime candidate due to its bright and recurrent eruptions which have been extensively monitored across the electromagnetic spectrum, including radio.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Technologies and Methods\n",
      "- Facilities such as the Very Large Array (VLA) and other radio telescopes are instrumental in capturing detailed radio emissions from recurrent novae. These observatories provide high-resolution data allowing astronomers to visualize changes over short timescales.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Radio observations are a crucial component of multi-wavelength studies of recurrent novae. They offer unique insights into the dynamics, energetics, and physical conditions of these binary systems post-eruption. As observational technology advances, our understanding of these fascinating astronomical objects continues to expand, providing new opportunities to explore their complex behaviors and interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "For more detailed and specific studies or recent advancements, accessing observational papers and data through arXiv or specific astro-ph resources would be beneficial.\n",

    "- **Details**: Your reflection should cover strengths, limitations, suggestions, and opportunities. The revised report should incorporate these elements to improve clarity and academic tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Configure the Response Call\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**: Use the specified model (e.g., `\"gpt-4o-mini\"`) and set the temperature equal to the `temperature` parameter of the graded function.\n",
    "- **Structure**: Make sure the response setup directs the model properly, ensuring the JSON format is adhered to without additional commentary.\n",

It effectively summarizes key aspects of radio emissions, such as ejecta properties and interactions with circumstellar material. Limitations: The report lacks specific references to recent studies or data, which diminishes its academic rigor. Additionally, it does not provide a detailed analysis of the implications of the findings or how they contribute to the broader field of astrophysics. Suggestions: To enhance the report, it would be beneficial to include citations from recent research articles, as well as a more thorough discussion of the implications of radio observations on our understanding of recurrent novae. Opportunities: There is an opportunity to expand this report into a comprehensive review article that synthesizes current knowledge and highlights gaps in the literature, potentially guiding future research directions in the field of radio astronomy and cataclysmic variables. \n",

      "## Overview of Recurrent Novae\n",
      "Recurrent novae are a category of cataclysmic variable stars characterized by multiple nova outbursts occurring over decades to a century. These systems typically consist of a white dwarf that accretes material from a companion star, which is often a red giant or a main sequence star. When a critical amount of material accumulates, a thermonuclear runaway occurs on the surface of the white dwarf, resulting in a nova eruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Radio Observations in Recurrent Novae\n",
      "Radio observations of recurrent novae are essential for gaining insights into the processes that occur before, during, and after nova outbursts. Key aspects include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Ejecta Properties**: Radio emissions facilitate the study of the ejected material's properties, including its velocity, mass, and morphology, thereby enhancing our understanding of the explosion dynamics.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Non-Thermal Emission**: Certain recurrent novae display non-thermal radio emissions, which may indicate the presence of shocks and particle acceleration mechanisms within the nova remnant.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Expansion and Cooling**: The radio spectrum serves as a tool for tracking the expansion and cooling of nova ejecta, providing a timeline for the evolution of the event.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Interaction with Circumstellar Material**: Radio observations can elucidate the interactions between nova ejecta and surrounding material, including pre-existing shells or the accretion disk associated with the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Magnetic Fields**: Polarimetric measurements can infer the presence of magnetic fields, offering insights into magneto-hydrodynamic processes at play.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Notable Recurrent Novae Observed in Radio\n",
      "- **RS Ophiuchi**: This recurrent nova is extensively studied and is known for its powerful and frequent eruptions. Radio observations have successfully mapped the expanding shock fronts and their interactions with the surrounding medium.\n",
      "- **T Pyxidis**: Another well-documented system in the radio spectrum, T Pyxidis has provided detailed information regarding the complex structures of ejecta and their evolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Radio observations are often complemented by data from other wavelengths, such as X-ray, optical, and infrared, to construct a comprehensive understanding of nova events and the underlying astrophysical processes. For more detailed and up-to-date information, accessing specific research publications or reviews from databases or journals specializing in astrophysics and radio astronomy is recommended. \n",
